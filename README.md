# DBMSProject
This is to provide an interface for the visitors/parents of a college by collecting their details and integrating with the college database and maintaining the records of them in the college database
Guests to the college will be interacting with a front-end website designed using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
The college database managed using MySQL is connected to the frontend using node.js
Guests here are classified into two types : 
1. Related to student - provides student details and verification details
2. Visitor (Not related to anyone in the campus) - provides some identification number for verification details
Guests will be able to choose the type of room for them through the website and submit it. After submitting it, the college admin will be approving it and send a confirmation mail to the user through their mail id provided in the website
After the approval, they will be allotted a room in the college for specified time in the college.
After the stay they can either pay through the portal or can directly pay to the college offline.
All the details about the stay, guests and their related student is maintained in the database along with the receipts of their payments.
